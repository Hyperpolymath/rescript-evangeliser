/* VALUES */

Core Values:
1. Compassion: Never shame developers for not knowing
2. Education: Teach through encouragement, not criticism
3. Inclusivity: Welcome all skill levels and backgrounds
4. Safety: Psychological and technical safety first
5. Transparency: Open source, open governance, open communication
6. Excellence: High quality code and documentation
7. Privacy: User data stays local, opt-in telemetry only
8. Security: Multiple layers of security by design
9. Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
10. Sustainability: Offline-first, minimal dependencies

Teaching Philosophy:
- Celebrate what learners already know
- Minimize criticism, maximize encouragement
- Show how new knowledge builds on existing knowledge
- Provide safety to experiment and make mistakes
- Use multiple modalities (text, visual, interactive)

/* INSPIRATION */

"You were close!"
  - Our core message to developers learning ReScript
  - Everyone has valuable knowledge to build upon
  - Learning is incremental, not all-or-nothing

"Strong opinions, loosely held"
  - We have architectural principles but adapt based on feedback
  - Data and community input drive decisions

"Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
  - In that order, always

/* DIVERSITY STATEMENT */

We welcome contributors of all:
- Skill levels (beginner to expert)
- Backgrounds (professional, hobbyist, student)
- Identities (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Locations (global community)
- Languages (English primary, translations welcome)
