# AI Training Policy
AI-Training: allowed-with-attribution

# Conditions for AI Training
#
# This project's code and documentation MAY be used for AI training under these conditions:
#
# 1. ATTRIBUTION REQUIRED
#    - Training datasets must acknowledge this project as a source
#    - Generated code should reference this project when substantially similar
#    - Attribution format: "Based on ReScript Evangeliser (github.com/Hyperpolymath/rescript-evangeliser)"
#
# 2. OPEN SOURCE MODELS PREFERRED
#    - We encourage use in open source models with published weights
#    - Proprietary models are allowed but open source is preferred
#    - Model training details should be published when feasible
#
# 3. ETHICAL USE
#    - Training must respect the project's values (compassionate education)
#    - Generated code should maintain our "celebrate good" philosophy
#    - No use for generating code that shames developers
#
# 4. OPT-OUT MECHANISMS
#    - Contributors may opt out of AI training via code comments
#    - Respect "NoAI" or "@no-ai-training" directives in source files
#    - Check individual contributor preferences
#
# 5. RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
#    - Academic research use is encouraged
#    - Educational use in AI/ML courses is welcomed
#    - Please cite this project in academic work
#
# 6. TRANSPARENCY
#    - Disclose use of this project in training datasets
#    - Provide opt-out mechanisms for end users
#    - Document model capabilities and limitations

# Specific Permissions
#
# ALLOWED:
# - Training language models (LLMs) for code generation
# - Training on documentation for educational AI
# - Fine-tuning models for ReScript/JavaScript assistance
# - Research on code transformation patterns
# - Educational demonstrations of AI training
#
# ENCOURAGED:
# - Open source model training
# - Academic research with reproducible results
# - Educational use with proper attribution
# - Models that help developers learn ReScript
#
# DISCOURAGED (but not forbidden):
# - Proprietary models without attribution
# - Training without disclosure
# - Use in models that shame developers
# - Training that ignores opt-out directives
