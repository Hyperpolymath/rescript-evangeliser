# Code of Conduct

## Compassionate Code Contribution Pledge (CCCP)

### Our Philosophy: "Celebrate Good, Minimize Bad, Show Better"

This Code of Conduct is based on the **Compassionate Code Contribution Pledge (CCCP)**, which extends beyond traditional codes of conduct to address **emotional safety** in software development.

We recognize that:
- **Imposter syndrome** is real and affects many developers
- **Public shaming** for technical mistakes is harmful and counterproductive
- **Learning requires safety** to experiment, fail, and grow
- **Diversity in experience** makes our community stronger

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a **harassment-free, psychologically safe experience** for everyone, regardless of:

- Age, body size, visible or invisible disability
- Ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Nationality, personal appearance, race, religion
- Sexual identity and orientation
- Technical skill level or background

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy** community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors ✅

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Celebrating knowledge**: Recognizing what others already know and can do
- **Encouraging learning**: Supporting others in their learning journey
- **Constructive feedback**: Providing feedback that builds up rather than tears down
- **Empathy**: Showing understanding and compassion towards others
- **Respect**: Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Graciousness**: Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- **Community focus**: Prioritizing what's best for the overall community
- **Accountability**: Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- **Patience**: Remembering everyone was a beginner once

### Unacceptable Behaviors ❌

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- **Shaming**: Belittling or ridiculing someone for not knowing something
- **Harassment**: Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- **Privacy violations**: Publishing others' private information without permission
- **RTFM attitudes**: Hostile responses like "Read the manual" or "Google it"
- **Gatekeeping**: Implying someone isn't a "real" developer/programmer
- **Unwelcome advances**: Sexual attention or advances of any kind
- **Professional misconduct**: Other conduct inappropriate in a professional setting
- **Discrimination**: Any form of discrimination based on protected characteristics
- **Imposter syndrome exploitation**: Deliberately undermining someone's confidence

## Emotional Safety Commitments

Beyond traditional code of conduct elements, we specifically commit to:

### 1. **No Shaming for Not Knowing**

- ❌ "How do you not know this?"
- ❌ "This is basic stuff"
- ❌ "Everyone knows that"
- ✅ "Great question! Here's how it works..."
- ✅ "I learned this recently too! Let me share..."

### 2. **Mistakes Are Learning Opportunities**

- ❌ "Wow, this code is terrible"
- ❌ "Did you even try?"
- ✅ "Here's how we can improve this together"
- ✅ "I see what you're trying to do. Have you considered...?"

### 3. **Celebrate Progress, Not Just Perfection**

- Recognize improvements and effort
- Acknowledge learning curves
- Support experimentation
- Normalize debugging and iteration

### 4. **Assume Good Intent**

- Give people the benefit of the doubt
- Ask for clarification before assuming malice
- Remember communication styles vary across cultures

### 5. **Right to Reversibility**

- Everyone has the right to change their mind
- Previous statements can be updated with new understanding
- Growth and evolution are encouraged

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Contributing code, documentation, or other materials to the project

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at:

- **Email**: See [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) for contact information
- **Anonymous Form**: [Coming soon]

All reports will be handled with **discretion and confidentiality**.

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:

1. Your contact information (if not anonymous)
2. Names (usernames) of anyone involved
3. Description of the incident
4. Context (links to comments, issues, etc.)
5. Any additional information that may be helpful

### Confidentiality

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time (typically 30 days). This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time (typically 90 days). No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal by:

1. Contacting a different maintainer than the one who made the decision
2. Providing additional context or information
3. Requesting mediation from a neutral third party

Appeals will be reviewed within 14 days.

## Positive Examples from Our Community

We celebrate these real examples of compassionate contribution:

> "I noticed you're trying to use pattern matching here. That's great! Pattern matching is powerful. One small thing - ReScript needs the switch keyword. Here's an example..."

> "I really like your approach to this problem. It reminds me of how I used to solve it in JavaScript! Here's how we can adapt it to ReScript's type system..."

> "Great question! I actually asked the same thing when I was learning. Here's what helped me understand..."
