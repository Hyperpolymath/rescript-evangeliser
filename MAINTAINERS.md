## Emeritus Maintainers

Maintainers who have moved on to other projects but whose contributions are forever appreciated:

*None yet - this is a new project!*

## Decision Making

### Consensus Model

For major decisions, we use **lazy consensus**:

1. Proposal is shared publicly (GitHub Issue or Discussion)
2. Community has 7 days to object
3. If no objections, proposal is accepted
4. If objections, discussion continues until consensus

### Voting

For rare cases where consensus fails:

- Simple majority vote among Level 3+ maintainers
- All votes are public
- Decisions documented in issues/discussions

### Veto Rights

Lead maintainer has veto power for:

- Security-critical decisions
- Code of Conduct enforcement
- Legal/licensing issues

Veto should be used sparingly and with explanation.

## Conflict Resolution

### Process

1. **Direct Communication**: Parties attempt to resolve directly
2. **Mediation**: Another maintainer mediates
3. **Team Decision**: Maintainer team discusses and decides
4. **External Mediation**: If needed, involve neutral third party

### Principles

- Assume good intent
- Focus on project health, not personal preferences
- Follow Code of Conduct
- Document decisions
- Move forward once decided

## Stepping Down

Maintainers can step down at any time:

1. **Notification**: Inform other maintainers
2. **Transition**: Help onboard replacement if possible
3. **Access Removal**: Repository access revoked
4. **Emeritus Status**: Recognized in this document
5. **Return Welcome**: Always welcome to return later
